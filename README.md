Accepts as inputs the button state for each frame, and plays through the level storing the memory state of each frame.  It also records a screenshot of each frame.  When the run is complete there is a DVR style playback where you can A/B compare the memory across frames with a visual indicator of what is happening in the level.

It also hooks into the load and write commands in the cpu recording the memory values written to and read each frame.
